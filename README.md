First attempt to port to KF5 - unusable

Klook is a quick preview feature based on Qt and Qt Quick, allows users to look 
at the contents of a file in the Dolphin

To build KLook you must have following programs and packages installed:
1) CMake
2) KDE Frameworks 5
3) Extra CMake Modules
4) Qt 5

To install it just do:
1) mkdir build
2) cd build
3) cmake .. && make && make install

If you want to use KLook from Dolphin you also have to apply Dolphin patches 
that make Klook show up on pressing space.
